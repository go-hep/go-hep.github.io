### Welcome to go-hep.

`go-hep` is a set of libraries and applications allowing High Energy Physicists to write efficient analysis code in the [Go](https://golang.org) programming language.

[Go](https://golang.org) brings the fast edit-compile-run cycle that interpreted language users know and the runtime efficiency that compiled languages users expect.
[go-hep](http://go-hep.github.io) provides the needed `HEP` oriented packages on top of this concurrency-enabled language.
 
`go-hep` currently sports the following packages:
- [go-hep/fads](https://github.com/go-hep/fads): a fast detector simulation toolkit
- [go-hep/fastjet](https://github.com/go-hep/fastjet): a jet clustering algorithms package (WIP)
- [go-hep/fmom](https://github.com/go-hep/fmom): a 4-vectors library
- [go-hep/fwk](https://github.com/go-hep/fwk): a concurrency-enabled framework
- [go-hep/hbook](https://github.com/go-hep/hbook): histograms and n-tuples (WIP)
- [go-hep/hplot](https://github.com/go-hep/hplot): interactive plotting (WIP)
- [go-hep/hepmc](https://github.com/go-hep/hepmc): `HepMC` in pure [Go](https://golang.org) (EDM + I/O)
- [go-hep/hepevt](https://github.com/go-hep/hepevt): `HEPEVT` bindings
- [go-hep/heppdt](https://github.com/go-hep/heppdt): `HEP` particle data table
- [go-hep/lhef](https://github.com/go-hep/lhef): Les Houches Event File format
- [go-hep/croot](https://github.com/go-hep/croot): bindings to a subset of [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch) I/O
- [go-hep/rio](https://github.com/go-hep/rio): `go-hep` record oriented I/O
- [go-hep/sio](https://github.com/go-hep/sio): `LCIO` I/O
- [go-hep/slha](https://github.com/go-hep/slha): `SUSY` Les Houches Accord I/O
